GameManager
===========

A basic java program for manging team based games.

This program managers the teams and their scores within a division. It was originally written for a local Futsal competition, but can be used for any form of team based competition.

Current Features
================

The program currently has the capability to create new "divisions", which includes the teams playing in that division and the scores for that division.

Once a division is created, the teams can be added using the add teams dialog.

Then match scores can be added.
The scores is simply based on what was scored.
Winner, looser and draws are calculated by the program.
To ensure teams that did not play do not get penalized by not playing, a 'did not play' tick box is included.

The program displays the results and statistics for all the teams in the division.

It is possible to save the division data, which is done in a '.div' file.

It also has the ability to export the information to a CSV file for viewing and printing in spreadsheet programs.
